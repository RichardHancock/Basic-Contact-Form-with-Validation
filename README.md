Basic-Contact-Form-with-Validation
==================================

A simple contact form using PHP. No JavaScript, so perfect for sites needing accessibility.

Free to use and modify, Giving me a credit (Link to here) is appreciated but not required,
but please leave the link to this repo in the code.

Install Instructions:
==================================
1. Copy the demo.php code into your code.
2. Get a reCAPTCHA account here: https://www.google.com/recaptcha
3. Copy the private and public keys into the designated areas in the code.
4. Set the mailto variable to your email address.

You can use the default css as a guide of the basic requirements, but you should probably
apply your own custom styles.
